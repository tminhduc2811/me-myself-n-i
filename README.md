# Just my site
The site is built with NextJS, TailwindCss to publish my profile as well as blogs, and other stuff

## Deploy
- Deploy automatically with Vercel
- Live at https://tmduc.com/

## In development
- We can take advantages of [SSG](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#getstaticprops-static-generation) and [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) to deploy new contents automatically by watching the changes in the contents directory.
